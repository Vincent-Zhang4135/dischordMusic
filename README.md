# dischordMusic
Following the ban of popular Music bots like Groovy and Rhythm from Discord, I wanted to create a simpler version on my own so that it would still be possible to listen to music on discord!

dischordMusic currently supports three commands:

# -p <your youtube url>
play a song from youtube of your choice

# -skip 
skip a song whenever
  
# -disconnect
disconnect the dischordMusic bot
